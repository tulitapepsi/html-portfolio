<h1>Some Of My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Here's a list of some of my favorite movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Evil Dead 2</h3>
<P>This is my favorite in the Evil Dead franchise. I've always found the practical effects to be very scary.</P>
<h3>Big Fish</h3>
<P>Although i'm not a HUGE fan of Tim Burton's style, Big Fish is a very touching movie that always makes me cry.</P>
<h3>Wayne's World</h3>
<p>Wayne's World is a movie that i've seen a thousand times and could probably quote from beginning to end!</p>
